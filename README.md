# Vechicle-drag-coefficient-prediction
This repository contains a project that leverages machine learning techniques to predict the drag coefficient (Cd) of vehicles based on features extracted from CAD images. The workflow uses data preprocessing, ensemble learning (a stacking regressor combining Gradient Boosting and Neural Networks), and model evaluation using Mean Squared Error.
